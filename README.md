## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favourite iOS apps and their best features are:
1. Discord: Seamless navigation experience, good readability, same or even-better functionalities than the computer version, finger movements are intuitive.
2. Notion: Automatically lays out dashboards into the mobile style, still making them look amazing in such a tight space. Strict to colors! They don't use colors outside of their pre-determined hex code palettes unless the user wants to. 
3. BeReal: Real-time reaction filter. Same-for-all set-off alarm. Truly only lets people who know each other be friends (no connection through Google, Facebook, and whatnot). 

## Notes

Challenge was familiarizing myself with the XCode environment.
